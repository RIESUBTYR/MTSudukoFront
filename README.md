#Suduko Instructions
Instructions to join the game
A 30sec timer will be started when the first person enters the gameroom
9 more players can enter the gameroom before this 30sec elapses
After 30sec the game will begin with all the players who joined before 30secs
Those who try to enter gameroom after the 30sec will have to wait until the present game is over
Instructions to play the game smartly
The progress bar of a player will be filled even if he entered a wrong value in one of the cells
The game will be solved only if all the values entered are correct values
Make smart use of the 'Show Mistakes' button. You can use it to find the value for a cell. Pressing the button will reveal all those cells in which wrong values are entered.
For example, if you know for sure that a cell can only have one of 3,5,8 as the right value, then you can press Show Mistakes after entering each of those three values. The value for which no red mark was shown after pressing Show Mistakes is the right value for the cell.
Since you can find the value for a cell by using the Show Mistakes button alone and completely neglecting the rest of the corresponding row, column or box there is a limitation for the usage of the button.i.e once you click the button, you will have to wait 10 secs before you can use the button once more.
